# Security Policy

The only completely secure system is the one that doesn't exist in the first place.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please disclose potential security issues by email to mail@wallpants.io.
I will try to provide an initial assessment of security reports within a week and should apply patches within 2 weeks
(also, feel free to contribute a fix for the issue).
